## 2015

- Project starts, see [blog post](https://www.whosonfirst.org/blog/2015/08/18/who-s-on-first/) with around 1M records from [Quattroshapes](https://web.archive.org/web/20220314041229/https://quattroshapes.com/), a compilation of authoritative national mapping agency data, as the basis for the first gazetteer records. While the data is authoritative, coverage is mostly limited to USA, Mexico, western Europe, portions of eastern Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, South Africa, Brazil, and Chile. Locality data is more available and original work based on Flickr and Foursquare checkin data mashed up with Where on Earth metadata, which allows coverage to expand to Canada, all of Europe (with some additional European Union data added in), Russia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, China, Malaysia, Thailand, and India.
- [Zetashapes](https://web.archive.org/web/20160304022454/http://zetashapes.com/) neighbourhood polygons for the United States ingested.
- Import localadmin from Quattroshapes as `localadmin` placetype. (Issue [#112](https://github.com/whosonfirst-data/whosonfirst-data/issues/112))

    - TODO: QS images here

Administrative level 1 (below) States and provinces in orange; regions shown in red. Mix of national mapping agency and Natural Earth.

Administrative level 2 (below) Counties in bright blue; regions shown in dark blue. National mapping agency data.

Local administrative level (below) In green. This level of government assumes municipal type control over the central town and surrounding countryside. National mapping agency data.

Localities (below) In yellow. In the USA this is the smallest unit of government with legal boundaries. For most other countries the localities here are informal parts of local administrative areas. Mix of national mapping agency, quattroshapes enumeration using foursquare checkins & custom data.

Administrative level 0 (below) In gray. Mix of national mapping agency and US State Department data.  Neighborhoods (below) In purple. Quattroshape enumeration from geo tagged photos in Flickr using GeoPlanet hierarchy.

Quattroshapes gazetteer (below) In light purple. Over 1 million administrative and populated places with around 800,000 having concordance between GeoNames.org and Yahoo! GeoPlanet WOE unique IDs.
